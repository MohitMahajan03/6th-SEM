# 3. Explain Dimensionality reduction with an example.

### Dimensionality Reduction

**Dimensionality reduction** is a process used to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. This is often done to simplify the dataset, making it easier to visualize, analyze, and use in machine learning models. It helps in combating the curse of dimensionality, reducing computational cost, and potentially improving model performance.

### Common Techniques

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - **Description:** PCA transforms the data into a new coordinate system by identifying the directions (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized. The top principal components are chosen to represent the data in fewer dimensions.
   - **Example:** Reducing a dataset with 10 features to 2 principal components for easier visualization.

2. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):**
   - **Description:** t-SNE is a non-linear technique primarily used for visualization in two or three dimensions. It reduces dimensionality while preserving the local structure of the data, making it particularly good for visualizing clusters.
   - **Example:** Visualizing high-dimensional data like handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset in 2D space.

### Example: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

#### Scenario
Imagine you have a dataset with 5 features about students: Math score, English score, Science score, History score, and Physical Education (PE) score. You want to reduce this to 2 dimensions to visualize the relationships between students more easily.

#### Steps in PCA

1. **Standardize the Data:**
   - Convert all scores to a common scale (e.g., z-scores).

2. **Compute the Covariance Matrix:**
   - Calculate the covariance matrix to understand how the features vary together.

3. **Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**
   - Determine the principal components by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

4. **Select Top Principal Components:**
   - Choose the top k principal components based on the eigenvalues. Here, k=2.

5. **Transform the Data:**
   - Project the original data onto the new 2D space formed by the top 2 principal components.

#### Result
The result is a new dataset with 2 dimensions that captures the most variance in the original 5-dimensional dataset. This reduced dataset can be visualized as a scatter plot, where each point represents a student and the axes represent the principal components.

### Visualization Example

Imagine the original dataset looks like this:
```
Math   English   Science   History   PE
90     85        95        70        80
85     80        88        65        75
...
```

After applying PCA, the transformed dataset might look like this:
```
PC1     PC2
3.2     1.1
2.8     0.9
...
```

You can then create a scatter plot using PC1 and PC2:
- **PC1:** The first principal component, capturing the most variance.
- **PC2:** The second principal component, orthogonal to PC1, capturing the next highest variance.

In this 2D scatter plot, each point (student) can be seen in relation to others, highlighting clusters or patterns that were not easily visible in the original 5-dimensional space.

### Summary
Dimensionality reduction, particularly through techniques like PCA, helps simplify complex datasets, making them easier to visualize and analyze while retaining essential information. This is crucial for exploratory data analysis and improving the efficiency of machine learning algorithms.

# 5. Explain Linear Regression and Logistic Regression in detail.


### Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Dependent Variable (Y):** The outcome or target variable we are trying to predict.
2. **Independent Variables (X):** The input variables used to make predictions.

#### Types:
1. **Simple Linear Regression:** Involves a single independent variable.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression:** Involves multiple independent variables.

#### Model:
The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The model can be expressed as:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon \]

- \( Y \) is the predicted value.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients representing the weight of each independent variable.
- \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) are the independent variables.
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

#### Example:

**Scenario:** Predicting house prices based on size (in square feet) and number of bedrooms.

**Data:**
```
Size (sq ft) | Bedrooms | Price ($)
-------------|----------|---------
1500         | 3        | 300,000
2000         | 4        | 400,000
```

**Model:**
\[ \text{Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Size} + \beta_2 \times \text{Bedrooms} \]

After training the model, you might get:
\[ \text{Price} = 50,000 + 150 \times \text{Size} + 10,000 \times \text{Bedrooms} \]

**Prediction:**
For a house with 1800 sq ft and 3 bedrooms:
\[ \text{Price} = 50,000 + 150 \times 1800 + 10,000 \times 3 = 350,000 \]

#### Evaluation:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average of the squares of the errors (the average squared difference between the estimated values and actual value).
- **R-squared:** Represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables.

---

### Logistic Regression

**Logistic Regression** is used for binary classification problems, where the outcome is a binary variable (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false). It predicts the probability of the occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic function.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Dependent Variable (Y):** The binary outcome (e.g., success/failure).
2. **Independent Variables (X):** The input variables used to make predictions.

#### Model:
The logistic regression model predicts the probability that the dependent variable \( Y \) belongs to a particular category. The model can be expressed as:

\[ P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n)}} \]

- \( P(Y=1|X) \) is the probability of the event occurring.
- \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients.

The output of the logistic function is a probability value between 0 and 1.

#### Example:

**Scenario:** Predicting whether a student will pass (1) or fail (0) based on hours studied and attendance.

**Data:**
```
Hours Studied | Attendance (%) | Pass/Fail
--------------|----------------|---------
10            | 80             | 1
5             | 60             | 0
```

**Model:**
\[ P(\text{Pass}=1|\text{Hours Studied}, \text{Attendance}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Hours Studied} + \beta_2 \times \text{Attendance})}} \]

After training the model, you might get:
\[ P(\text{Pass}=1|\text{Hours Studied}, \text{Attendance}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(0.5 + 0.3 \times \text{Hours Studied} + 0.02 \times \text{Attendance})}} \]

**Prediction:**
For a student who studied 7 hours and has 70% attendance:
\[ \text{Log-odds} = 0.5 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.02 \times 70 = 3.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Pass}=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-3.1}} \approx 0.957 \]

The model predicts a 95.7% chance of passing.

#### Evaluation:
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision and Recall:** Measures the accuracy of positive predictions and the ability to find all positive instances, respectively.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC Curve and AUC:** Measures the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate.

### Summary

- **Linear Regression** is used for predicting continuous outcomes and assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression** is used for binary classification, predicting the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.

Both techniques are foundational to machine learning and have wide applications in various fields.

# 11. Explain the Bayes theorem and describe the brute force MAP learning algorithm.

### Bayes Theorem

**Bayes Theorem** is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It is named after Thomas Bayes and is a key principle in Bayesian inference, which is widely used in various fields, including machine learning.

#### Bayes Theorem Formula

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- **\( P(H|E) \)**: Posterior probability. The probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Likelihood. The probability of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability. The initial probability of the hypothesis \( H \) before observing the evidence \( E \).
- **\( P(E) \)**: Marginal likelihood. The total probability of the evidence \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

### Brute Force MAP Learning Algorithm

**Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)** estimation is a method used in Bayesian statistics to estimate the most probable hypothesis given the observed data. The brute force MAP learning algorithm involves evaluating all possible hypotheses to find the one with the highest posterior probability.

#### Steps of the Brute Force MAP Learning Algorithm

1. **Define the Hypotheses:**
   - Identify all possible hypotheses \( H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n \).

2. **Compute the Prior Probabilities:**
   - Determine the prior probability \( P(H_i) \) for each hypothesis \( H_i \).

3. **Collect Evidence:**
   - Gather the evidence \( E \).

4. **Compute the Likelihoods:**
   - Calculate the likelihood \( P(E|H_i) \) for each hypothesis \( H_i \).

5. **Compute the Posterior Probabilities:**
   - Use Bayes Theorem to compute the posterior probability \( P(H_i|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H_i \):
     \[ P(H_i|E) = \frac{P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]
   - Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, it can be ignored for finding the hypothesis with the maximum posterior probability:
     \[ P(H_i|E) \propto P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]

6. **Select the Hypothesis with the Highest Posterior Probability:**
   - Find the hypothesis \( H_{MAP} \) that maximizes the posterior probability:
     \[ H_{MAP} = \arg\max_{H_i} P(H_i|E) \]
     \[ H_{MAP} = \arg\max_{H_i} \left[ P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \right] \]

### Example

Let's consider a simple example of a spam filter to illustrate the Bayes Theorem and the brute force MAP learning algorithm.

#### Scenario

You want to classify an email as spam or not spam based on the presence of certain words.

1. **Hypotheses:**
   - \( H_1 \): The email is spam.
   - \( H_2 \): The email is not spam.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability that any given email is spam.
   - \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability that any given email is not spam.

3. **Evidence:**
   - \( E \): The email contains the word "discount".

4. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability that the word "discount" appears in a spam email.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability that the word "discount" appears in a non-spam email.

5. **Posterior Probabilities:**
   - Compute the posterior probability for each hypothesis using Bayes Theorem:
     \[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
     \[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

6. **MAP Hypothesis:**
   - Compare the posterior probabilities and select the hypothesis with the highest value:
     \[ H_{MAP} = \arg\max_{H_i} \left[ P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \right] \]

### Summary

- **Bayes Theorem** provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
- The **Brute Force MAP Learning Algorithm** involves evaluating all possible hypotheses to find the one with the highest posterior probability. This method is straightforward but computationally intensive for large hypothesis spaces.
- Both concepts are fundamental in Bayesian inference and are widely used in machine learning and statistical analysis.

### Example: Spam Email Classification

Let's classify emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on the presence of certain words.

#### Training Data

| Email ID | "Discount" | "Buy" | "Cheap" | Class   |
|----------|------------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1        | Yes        | Yes   | Yes     | Spam    |
| 2        | Yes        | No    | Yes     | Spam    |
| 3        | No         | Yes   | No      | Not Spam|
| 4        | No         | No    | Yes     | Not Spam|
| 5        | Yes        | Yes   | No      | Spam    |

#### Step 1: Calculate Prior Probabilities

Calculate the prior probability for each class:
\[ P(\text{Spam}) = \frac{\text{Number of Spam Emails}}{\text{Total Number of Emails}} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(\text{Not Spam}) = \frac{\text{Number of Not Spam Emails}}{\text{Total Number of Emails}} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \]

#### Step 2: Calculate Likelihoods

Calculate the likelihood of each feature given each class. For example:
\[ P(\text{"Discount"}|\text{Spam}) = \frac{\text{Number of Spam Emails with "Discount"}}{\text{Number of Spam Emails}} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(\text{"Discount"}|\text{Not Spam}) = \frac{\text{Number of Not Spam Emails with "Discount"}}{\text{Number of Not Spam Emails}} = 0 \]

Similarly, compute the likelihoods for the other features.

#### Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem

For a new email with features "Discount = Yes", "Buy = Yes", "Cheap = Yes", calculate the posterior probabilities for each class:

\[ P(\text{Spam}|\text{Discount, Buy, Cheap}) \propto P(\text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{"Discount"}|\text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{"Buy"}|\text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{"Cheap"}|\text{Spam}) \]
\[ P(\text{Spam}|\text{Discount, Buy, Cheap}) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.67 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot 0.67 \]

\[ P(\text{Not Spam}|\text{Discount, Buy, Cheap}) \propto P(\text{Not Spam}) \cdot P(\text{"Discount"}|\text{Not Spam}) \cdot P(\text{"Buy"}|\text{Not Spam}) \cdot P(\text{"Cheap"}|\text{Not Spam}) \]
\[ P(\text{Not Spam}|\text{Discount, Buy, Cheap}) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.5 \]

#### Step 4: Classification

Compare the posterior probabilities. Since \( P(\text{Not Spam}|\text{Discount, Buy, Cheap}) = 0 \), the email is classified as "Spam".

### Summary

The Naïve Bayes Classifier is a simple yet effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with the assumption of conditional independence among features. It is particularly useful for text classification tasks, such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. Despite its simplicity and the strong independence assumption, it often performs surprisingly well in practice.

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of interconnected units called neurons or nodes, which work together to solve specific problems. ANNs are a fundamental component of deep learning and are widely used for various complex tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

### Key Concepts of ANNs

1. **Neurons (Nodes):** The basic units of an ANN, which receive input, process it, and pass the output to the next layer of neurons.
2. **Layers:**
   - **Input Layer:** The first layer that receives the initial data.
   - **Hidden Layers:** Intermediate layers that process inputs received from the input layer, applying transformations through weights and biases.
   - **Output Layer:** The final layer that produces the output of the network.
3. **Weights and Biases:** Parameters that are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error in the network’s predictions. Weights determine the importance of inputs, and biases allow the model to fit the data better by providing additional degrees of freedom.
4. **Activation Function:** A function applied to the output of each neuron to introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
5. **Learning Rate:** A hyperparameter that controls how much the weights and biases are adjusted during each training step.
6. **Loss Function:** A function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The goal of training is to minimize this loss.
7. **Backpropagation:** An algorithm used to update the weights and biases by calculating the gradient of the loss function and adjusting the parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss.

### How ANNs Work

1. **Initialization:** The network starts with random weights and biases.
2. **Forward Propagation:** Inputs are fed into the input layer, and through the weighted connections and activation functions, the inputs are processed and passed forward through the hidden layers to the output layer, where the final prediction is made.
3. **Loss Calculation:** The output is compared to the actual target values using the loss function to compute the error.
4. **Backpropagation:** The error is propagated backward through the network, and the weights and biases are updated to minimize the loss.
5. **Iteration:** The forward and backward propagation steps are repeated for a number of iterations (epochs) until the network learns to make accurate predictions.

### Example of ANN

Let’s consider a simple example of an ANN for binary classification, such as determining whether an email is spam or not spam.

#### Architecture

- **Input Layer:** 2 neurons (features like the number of times "buy" appears, and the number of times "free" appears in the email).
- **Hidden Layer:** 2 neurons.
- **Output Layer:** 1 neuron (output value 0 or 1, indicating non-spam or spam).

#### Activation Function

- **Hidden Layer:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
- **Output Layer:** Sigmoid (since the task is binary classification).

#### Training Process

1. **Initialization:** Randomly initialize weights and biases.
2. **Forward Propagation:** Calculate the output of the neurons layer by layer using the activation functions.
3. **Loss Calculation:** Use a loss function like binary cross-entropy to measure the error.
4. **Backpropagation:** Compute the gradients of the loss with respect to each weight and bias, and update them using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.
5. **Iteration:** Repeat the process over many epochs until the network minimizes the loss and accurately classifies the emails.

### Applications of ANNs

- **Image Recognition:** Identifying objects, faces, and scenes in images.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbots.
- **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language into text.
- **Medical Diagnosis:** Analyzing medical images and patient data to assist in diagnosing diseases.
- **Financial Forecasting:** Predicting stock prices, market trends, and credit scoring.

### Summary

Artificial Neural Networks are powerful computational models capable of learning and making predictions from data. By mimicking the structure and function of the human brain, ANNs can solve complex problems in various fields, making them an essential tool in modern artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### Single Layer Perceptron and XOR Function

A **single layer perceptron** is a type of artificial neural network with a single layer of output neurons directly connected to input features. It is essentially a linear classifier, meaning it can only solve problems where the data is linearly separable. 

The **XOR function** (exclusive OR) is a classic example of a problem that is not linearly separable. The XOR function takes two binary inputs and outputs 1 if the inputs are different, and 0 if they are the same. Here is the truth table for the XOR function:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | XOR Output |
|---------|---------|------------|
|    0    |    0    |      0     |
|    0    |    1    |      1     |
|    1    |    0    |      1     |
|    1    |    1    |      0     |

### Visualization of XOR

Plotting the XOR function on a 2D plane:

- (0, 0) maps to 0
- (0, 1) maps to 1
- (1, 0) maps to 1
- (1, 1) maps to 0

If you visualize these points, you'll see that no straight line can separate the points where the output is 1 from the points where the output is 0. This means the XOR problem is not linearly separable.

### Why a Single Layer Perceptron Fails

A single layer perceptron computes the weighted sum of the input features, adds a bias, and applies an activation function (usually a step function or a sigmoid for binary classification). Mathematically, it computes:

\[ y = f(\sum_{i} w_i x_i + b) \]

where:
- \( x_i \) are the input features,
- \( w_i \) are the weights,
- \( b \) is the bias,
- \( f \) is the activation function,
- \( y \) is the output.

For a single layer perceptron to classify the XOR function correctly, it would need to find a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that separates the output classes. However, because the XOR function is not linearly separable, no such line exists.

### Intuitive Explanation

- **Linearity:** A single layer perceptron can only create a linear decision boundary. XOR requires a non-linear decision boundary because the points (0, 1) and (1, 0) should be classified differently from (0, 0) and (1, 1).
- **Decision Regions:** A linear classifier divides the input space into two regions with a straight line. For XOR, the correct classification would require at least two decision boundaries, which a single perceptron cannot provide.

### Solving XOR with Multi-layer Perceptron

To solve the XOR problem, you need a **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** with at least one hidden layer. The hidden layer introduces non-linearity, allowing the network to create complex decision boundaries. 

A typical MLP for XOR might have:
- **Input Layer:** 2 neurons (one for each input feature).
- **Hidden Layer:** 2 neurons.
- **Output Layer:** 1 neuron.

Here's how it works:
1. **Hidden Layer:** The hidden layer neurons create intermediate features that can linearly separate the data in a higher-dimensional space.
2. **Output Layer:** The output layer then combines these features to produce the final classification.

#### Example Architecture for XOR

1. **Inputs:** \( x_1, x_2 \)
2. **Hidden Layer Neurons:**
   - \( h_1 = \sigma(w_{11}x_1 + w_{12}x_2 + b_1) \)
   - \( h_2 = \sigma(w_{21}x_1 + w_{22}x_2 + b_2) \)
3. **Output Layer Neuron:**
   - \( y = \sigma(w_{31}h_1 + w_{32}h_2 + b_3) \)

Here, \( \sigma \) is an activation function (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU).

### Summary

- **Single Layer Perceptron:** Can only solve linearly separable problems.
- **XOR Function:** Not linearly separable, requiring non-linear decision boundaries.
- **Solution:** Multi-layer perceptron with at least one hidden layer introduces the necessary non-linearity to correctly classify XOR.

This fundamental limitation of single layer perceptrons is one of the reasons why multi-layer architectures (deep learning) are so powerful and widely used.

## 22. Differentiate between Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent

### Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent

**Gradient Descent (GD)** and **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** are optimization algorithms used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models. Both methods aim to find the optimal set of parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the loss function, but they do so in different ways.

### Gradient Descent (GD)

**Gradient Descent** is an optimization algorithm that computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to all parameters on the entire dataset before updating the parameters. 

#### Characteristics:

1. **Batch Size:** Uses the entire dataset to compute gradients.
2. **Updates:** Updates parameters after processing the whole dataset.
3. **Convergence:** Usually more stable but can be slow, especially for large datasets.
4. **Computation:** Computationally expensive for large datasets because it needs to process the entire dataset for each update.

#### Algorithm:

1. **Initialize:** Start with initial parameters (weights and biases).
2. **Compute Gradient:** Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter for the entire dataset.
3. **Update Parameters:** Adjust the parameters by moving them in the direction opposite to the gradient.
4. **Repeat:** Repeat the process until convergence (i.e., when the change in the loss function or parameters is below a certain threshold).

#### Update Rule:

\[ \theta = \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \]

where:
- \( \theta \) are the parameters,
- \( \eta \) is the learning rate,
- \( \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \) is the gradient of the loss function \( J \) with respect to \( \theta \).

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

**Stochastic Gradient Descent** is an optimization algorithm that computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to a single data point (or a small batch of data points) and updates the parameters immediately.

#### Characteristics:

1. **Batch Size:** Uses one data point (or a small batch) to compute gradients.
2. **Updates:** Updates parameters after each data point (or mini-batch).
3. **Convergence:** Faster updates, which can lead to quicker convergence. However, the updates can be noisy, leading to fluctuations in the loss function.
4. **Computation:** Less computationally expensive per update, making it suitable for large datasets.

#### Algorithm:

1. **Initialize:** Start with initial parameters (weights and biases).
2. **Shuffle Data:** Randomly shuffle the training data.
3. **Compute Gradient:** For each training example (or mini-batch), calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
4. **Update Parameters:** Adjust the parameters immediately using the calculated gradient.
5. **Repeat:** Repeat the process for all training examples and continue for several epochs.

#### Update Rule:

\[ \theta = \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \]

where:
- \( x^{(i)}, y^{(i)} \) are the i-th training example and its corresponding label,
- \( \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \) is the gradient of the loss function \( J \) with respect to \( \theta \) for the i-th example.

### Key Differences

1. **Batch Size:**
   - **GD:** Uses the entire dataset.
   - **SGD:** Uses one data point or a mini-batch.
   
2. **Updates:**
   - **GD:** Updates parameters after processing the entire dataset.
   - **SGD:** Updates parameters after each data point or mini-batch.
   
3. **Computation:**
   - **GD:** Computationally expensive for large datasets.
   - **SGD:** More computationally efficient per update, suitable for large datasets.
   
4. **Convergence:**
   - **GD:** More stable convergence but can be slower.
   - **SGD:** Faster updates with potential fluctuations and noise, which can help escape local minima but may lead to less stable convergence.
   
5. **Efficiency:**
   - **GD:** Not efficient for large datasets due to high computational cost per update.
   - **SGD:** More efficient for large datasets due to lower computational cost per update.

### Summary

- **Gradient Descent (GD):** Uses the entire dataset for each update, leading to stable but potentially slow convergence, especially for large datasets.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Uses individual data points or mini-batches for updates, leading to faster but noisier convergence, making it suitable for large datasets and online learning.

Both methods are fundamental in training machine learning models, and the choice between GD and SGD depends on the specific requirements of the problem, such as dataset size, computational resources, and the desired speed of convergence.

## 23. Write Back Propagation algorithm

>Notes

## 24. Outline the stochastic gradient descent and its variants in deep learning.

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Its Variants in Deep Learning

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** is a widely used optimization algorithm in deep learning for training models by minimizing the loss function. It updates the model parameters incrementally, using a single data point or a small mini-batch at a time, making it more efficient for large datasets compared to traditional Gradient Descent.

### Basic Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

**Algorithm:**

1. **Initialize** parameters \( \theta \) (weights and biases).
2. **Shuffle** the training dataset.
3. For each training example \( (x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \):
   - Compute the gradient \( \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \) of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
   - Update the parameters: \( \theta = \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \), where \( \eta \) is the learning rate.
4. **Repeat** until convergence.

### Variants of SGD in Deep Learning

Several variants of SGD have been developed to address its limitations and improve performance. These variants mainly aim to adapt the learning rate and smooth the parameter updates.

#### 1. Mini-batch Gradient Descent

**Mini-batch Gradient Descent** combines the advantages of both SGD and Batch Gradient Descent by computing the gradient on a small batch of data points.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Initialize** parameters \( \theta \).
2. **Shuffle** the training dataset.
3. Divide the dataset into mini-batches of size \( m \).
4. For each mini-batch \( B_k \):
   - Compute the gradient \( \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta; B_k) \).
   - Update the parameters: \( \theta = \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta; B_k) \).
5. **Repeat** until convergence.

#### 2. SGD with Momentum

**Momentum** helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations.

**Update Rule:**

\[ v_t = \gamma v_{t-1} + \eta \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \]
\[ \theta = \theta - v_t \]

where:
- \( v_t \) is the velocity (update direction).
- \( \gamma \) is the momentum coefficient (usually between 0.8 and 0.9).

#### 3. Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)

**NAG** is a variant of momentum that anticipates the future position of the parameters and computes the gradient at this approximate future position.

**Update Rule:**

\[ v_t = \gamma v_{t-1} + \eta \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta - \gamma v_{t-1}) \]
\[ \theta = \theta - v_t \]

#### 4. Adagrad

**Adagrad** adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing larger updates for infrequent parameters and smaller updates for frequent ones.

**Update Rule:**

\[ \theta = \theta - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_{t,ii} + \epsilon}} \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \]

where:
- \( G_t \) is the diagonal matrix with the sum of squares of past gradients.
- \( \epsilon \) is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

#### 5. RMSprop

**RMSprop** addresses Adagrad's diminishing learning rate issue by using a moving average of the squared gradients.

**Update Rule:**

\[ E[g^2]_t = \gamma E[g^2]_{t-1} + (1 - \gamma) g_t^2 \]
\[ \theta = \theta - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{E[g^2]_t + \epsilon}} \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \]

#### 6. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

**Adam** combines the benefits of RMSprop and momentum by computing adaptive learning rates for each parameter.

**Update Rule:**

\[ m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \]
\[ v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) (\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta))^2 \]
\[ \hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \]
\[ \hat{v}_t = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \]
\[ \theta = \theta - \eta \frac{\hat{m}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \]

where:
- \( m_t \) and \( v_t \) are estimates of the first moment (mean) and the second moment (uncentered variance) of the gradients.
- \( \beta_1 \) and \( \beta_2 \) are decay rates for the moving averages.

### Summary

- **SGD:** Updates parameters using a single data point.
- **Mini-batch GD:** Uses small batches of data points, balancing between SGD and Batch GD.
- **Momentum and NAG:** Introduce velocity to accelerate convergence and dampen oscillations.
- **Adagrad:** Adapts learning rates based on past gradients.
- **RMSprop:** Uses a moving average to adjust learning rates, avoiding Adagrad's diminishing learning rates.
- **Adam:** Combines momentum and RMSprop, adapting learning rates based on the first and second moments of gradients. 

These variants enhance the basic SGD by improving convergence speed, stability, and robustness, making them well-suited for training deep learning models.

## A note on Classification Report

### Classification Report in Machine Learning

A classification report is a performance evaluation metric in machine learning that provides a comprehensive overview of the predictive quality of a classification algorithm. It includes several key parameters that help in understanding how well a model is performing. Below are the major parameters typically included in a classification report:

1. **Precision**
2. **Recall (Sensitivity)**
3. **F1-Score**
4. **Support**
5. **Accuracy**
6. **Macro Average**
7. **Weighted Average**

### Major Parameters

#### 1. Precision
Precision, also known as Positive Predictive Value, measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.

\[ \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Positives (FP)}} \]

High precision indicates a low false positive rate.

#### 2. Recall (Sensitivity)
Recall, also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate, measures the ability of the model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset. It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.

\[ \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Negatives (FN)}} \]

High recall indicates a low false negative rate.

#### 3. F1-Score
The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances the trade-off between precision and recall. It is particularly useful when you need a balance between precision and recall and when the class distribution is imbalanced.

\[ \text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \]

A high F1-Score indicates both high precision and high recall.

#### 4. Support
Support is the number of actual occurrences of each class in the dataset. It gives an idea of the class distribution and helps in understanding how the metrics are calculated based on the sample size.

#### 5. Accuracy
Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. It is the most intuitive performance measure but can be misleading if the data has an unequal class distribution.

\[ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{True Negatives (TN)}}{\text{Total Observations}} \]

Accuracy is useful when the class distribution is uniform.

### Additional Metrics

#### 6. Macro Average
Macro average calculates the metric independently for each class and then takes the average, treating all classes equally.

\[ \text{Macro Average} = \frac{\text{Precision}_{class1} + \text{Precision}_{class2} + \ldots + \text{Precision}_{classN}}{N} \]

It is useful when you want to understand the overall performance of the model across all classes without considering the class imbalance.

#### 7. Weighted Average
Weighted average calculates the metric for each class independently but takes the class distribution into account by weighting each class by its support.

\[ \text{Weighted Average} = \frac{\text{Support}_{class1} \cdot \text{Precision}_{class1} + \text{Support}_{class2} \cdot \text{Precision}_{class2} + \ldots}{\text{Total Support}} \]

This average is useful when you want to understand the model’s performance across all classes while considering class imbalance.

### Example of a Classification Report

Here is an example of a classification report for a binary classification problem:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.88      0.90      0.89       100
           1       0.85      0.82      0.83        50

    accuracy                           0.87       150
   macro avg       0.86      0.86      0.86       150
weighted avg       0.87      0.87      0.87       150
```

### Explanation of the Example

- **Class 0:**
  - **Precision:** 0.88 (88% of the instances predicted as class 0 are actually class 0)
  - **Recall:** 0.90 (90% of the instances of class 0 are correctly identified)
  - **F1-Score:** 0.89 (Harmonic mean of precision and recall for class 0)
  - **Support:** 100 (Number of actual instances of class 0)

- **Class 1:**
  - **Precision:** 0.85 (85% of the instances predicted as class 1 are actually class 1)
  - **Recall:** 0.82 (82% of the instances of class 1 are correctly identified)
  - **F1-Score:** 0.83 (Harmonic mean of precision and recall for class 1)
  - **Support:** 50 (Number of actual instances of class 1)

- **Accuracy:** 0.87 (87% of the total predictions are correct)
- **Macro Avg:**
  - **Precision:** 0.86 (Average precision across both classes)
  - **Recall:** 0.86 (Average recall across both classes)
  - **F1-Score:** 0.86 (Average F1-Score across both classes)

- **Weighted Avg:**
  - **Precision:** 0.87 (Weighted average precision considering class support)
  - **Recall:** 0.87 (Weighted average recall considering class support)
  - **F1-Score:** 0.87 (Weighted average F1-Score considering class support)

### Summary

A classification report provides a detailed breakdown of the performance of a classification model, including precision, recall, F1-score, support, accuracy, macro average, and weighted average. These metrics help in evaluating the model's effectiveness, especially in the presence of class imbalance.
