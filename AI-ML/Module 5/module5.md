## Applications of ML on IoT.

* ML plays a significant role in enhancing the capabilities of IOT devices and systems
* Applications: 
    * Predictive maintenance: ML algorithms can predict equipment failures before they occur reducing down time.   
    * Anomaly detection : ML can identify unusual patterns that may indicate security breaches or system failures
    * Smart transportation: ML imporoves traffic management, route optimization and autonomous vehicle development
    * Resource management: Optimises energy usage and operation efficiency in smart homes and industries
    * Personalization: Customizes user experience in smart devices and application.

## IOT Data Acquisition Architecture
IoT system architecture is often descried as a four stage process in which data flows from sensors attached to things through a ework and eventually
on to a corporate data center or the cloud for processing, analsis and storage

In the IoT, a thing could be a machine, a building or even a person. 

### Stage 1
THe process starts with sensors and actuators, the cnneced devices that monitor (in the case f sensors) or control (in the case of actuators) some thing or physical process. Sensors capture data regarding the status of a process.

### Stage 2
A data acqusition system (DAS) collecs raw data from the sensros and converts it fro analog to digital form. The DAS then aggregates and formats the data

### Stage 3
Once the IOT data has been digitized and aggregatd, it will need processing to further reduce the data volume before it goes to the data center or cloud. The edge device may perform some analytics as part of the preprocessing. ML can bevery helpful in this stage to provide feedback into the system and improve the process on an ongoing basis, without waiting for instructions to come back from the corporate data center or cloud. Processing take place on a deice in a location close to where the sensors reside, such as in an on-site wiring closet. 

### Stage 4
* At this stage, powerful IT sysrems can be brought to bear to analze, manage, and securely store the data
* Data from multiple field sies/sensors is comined to provide a broader picture of the overall IoT system and delier actionable insights to both IT and business managers.
