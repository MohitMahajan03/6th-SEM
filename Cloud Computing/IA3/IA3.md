# 2. Architecture of MapReduce in Hadoop and Running a Job in Hadoop

### Architecture of MapReduce in Hadoop

MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. In Hadoop, MapReduce is the core component for data processing. Here's an overview of its architecture:

1. **Input Data**: The data to be processed is usually stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The input data is divided into splits, and each split is processed by a map task.

2. **Map Task**: Each map task takes a split as input and processes the data to generate key-value pairs. The map function is applied to each record in the input split. The output of the map task is a set of intermediate key-value pairs.

3. **Shuffle and Sort**: The intermediate key-value pairs produced by the map tasks are partitioned, sorted, and shuffled. Each reducer gets all the values associated with a particular key. This step ensures that all values for a given key are grouped together.

4. **Reduce Task**: Each reduce task takes the sorted key-value pairs as input and merges those values to generate the final output. The reduce function is applied to each group of values associated with the same key.

5. **Output Data**: The output of the reduce tasks is written back to HDFS. This output can then be used for further processing or analysis.

### Components of MapReduce in Hadoop

1. **JobTracker**: The JobTracker is a master node that manages the execution of MapReduce jobs. It schedules the jobs, monitors them, and re-executes the failed tasks. The JobTracker is responsible for resource management and job scheduling.

2. **TaskTracker**: The TaskTrackers are worker nodes that run the map and reduce tasks as directed by the JobTracker. Each TaskTracker manages a pool of worker threads to execute the tasks. It sends heartbeats to the JobTracker to provide updates on the status of the tasks.

3. **HDFS**: The Hadoop Distributed File System is used for storing input and output data. It is a distributed, scalable, and portable file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.

4. **JobClient**: The JobClient is a client-side component that submits the MapReduce jobs to the JobTracker. It also provides information about the job's status and statistics.

### Running a Job in Hadoop

1. **Write the MapReduce Program**: Write a MapReduce program that includes the map and reduce functions. The program should specify the input and output data formats and paths.

2. **Compile and Package**: Compile the MapReduce program and package it into a JAR file. This JAR file will be submitted to the Hadoop cluster for execution.

3. **Submit the Job**: Use the Hadoop command line interface or an API to submit the JAR file to the Hadoop cluster. The JobClient sends the job configuration and data to the JobTracker.

4. **Job Initialization**: The JobTracker initializes the job and divides it into multiple map and reduce tasks. It then assigns these tasks to TaskTrackers in the cluster.

5. **Map Phase**: TaskTrackers execute the map tasks on the input data splits. The map function processes each record and produces intermediate key-value pairs.

6. **Shuffle and Sort Phase**: The intermediate data from the map tasks is shuffled and sorted. The data is partitioned based on the keys and prepared for the reduce phase.

7. **Reduce Phase**: TaskTrackers execute the reduce tasks on the sorted key-value pairs. The reduce function processes each key and its associated values to produce the final output.

8. **Output**: The output of the reduce tasks is written to HDFS. The JobTracker updates the job status and notifies the JobClient of the completion of the job.

9. **Monitoring and Debugging**: Throughout the job execution, the JobTracker and TaskTrackers provide status updates and logs. These logs can be used for monitoring the job's progress and debugging any issues.

By following these steps, you can run a MapReduce job in Hadoop and process large-scale data in a distributed and efficient manner.

- Ensuring that tasks running in parallel do not interfere with each other and that data dependencies are managed correctly. This involves coordinating the timing of tasks and the exchange of data between them【14:1†source】.

#### Scheduling
- Deciding the order in which tasks are executed. This includes both intra-job scheduling (managing the sequence of tasks within a single job) and inter-job scheduling (managing the sequence of multiple jobs)【14:1†source】.

### Conclusion
Mapping applications to parallel and distributed systems is a critical aspect of leveraging modern computational architectures. By understanding and applying appropriate techniques for partitioning, mapping, synchronization, communication, and scheduling, developers can enhance the performance and efficiency of their applications. This approach not only reduces computation time but also optimizes resource utilization, making it essential for tackling complex and large-scale problems in various scientific and industrial domains.

# 6.Big-Table data model and system structure

### BigTable Data Model and System Structure

BigTable, a NoSQL system designed by Google, is aimed at storing and retrieving large amounts of structured and semi-structured data efficiently. It serves various applications, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Analytics, by providing a scalable and fault-tolerant storage solution.

#### BigTable Data Model

BigTable's data model is a sparse, distributed, multidimensional sorted map. The data model can be understood through the example of a "Web Table," which stores information about web pages:

1. **Rows**: Each row is identified by a unique key, such as a URL. Rows are maintained in lexicographical order by the row key, which allows for efficient range queries.
2. **Columns**: Column keys are grouped into sets known as column families. Column family keys are used to store different types of data associated with each row key. For example, a web table might have column families for "contents" and "anchors."
3. **Timestamps**: Each cell in the table can contain multiple versions of the same data, indexed by timestamps. This allows the system to store different versions of data, enabling time-based queries and historical data analysis.

The structure allows BigTable to manage billions of rows and columns, efficiently handling large volumes of data while providing the flexibility to store various types of information.

#### BigTable System Structure

BigTable's system architecture consists of several key components that work together to provide high availability and performance:

1. **BigTable Master**: The master node is responsible for managing metadata and handling load balancing across the system. It also coordinates the allocation and deallocation of resources.
2. **Tablet Servers**: Data is stored in tablets, which are managed by tablet servers. Each tablet contains a contiguous range of rows from the table. Tablet servers handle read and write requests from clients and perform compaction and garbage collection tasks.
3. **Clients**: BigTable clients interact with the system through a client library, which communicates with the BigTable master and tablet servers to perform data operations.
4. **Google File System (GFS)**: GFS is used for storing persistent data. Each tablet's data is stored in GFS, which ensures high availability and fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple servers.
5. **Chubby Lock Service**: Chubby is a distributed lock service used for managing metadata and ensuring consistency. It plays a crucial role in master election and maintaining the overall system's integrity.
6. **Scheduler**: The scheduler is responsible for scheduling jobs and managing resource allocation across the cluster.
7. **MapReduce**: MapReduce is often used for processing large datasets stored in BigTable, enabling efficient data analysis and manipulation.

#### Tablet Location Hierarchy

BigTable employs a three-level hierarchy to locate data:

1. **Root Tablet**: The root tablet contains the location of all tablets in a special metadata table. This metadata table stores the locations of user tablets.
2. **Metadata Tablets**: These tablets store the locations of user data tablets, organized by a row key that encodes the table identifier and end row.
3. **User Tablets**: Actual user data is stored in these tablets, each responsible for a specific range of rows.

This hierarchical structure ensures efficient data location and retrieval, minimizing the overhead associated with locating and accessing data across a vast distributed system.

### Conclusion

BigTable's design allows it to handle large-scale data storage and retrieval efficiently. Its data model, system architecture, and hierarchical structure for data location provide a robust framework for managing vast amounts of data, supporting high read/write rates, and ensuring fault tolerance and scalability.
