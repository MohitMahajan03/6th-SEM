# 2. Architecture of MapReduce in Hadoop and Running a Job in Hadoop

### Architecture of MapReduce in Hadoop

MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. In Hadoop, MapReduce is the core component for data processing. Here's an overview of its architecture:

1. **Input Data**: The data to be processed is usually stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The input data is divided into splits, and each split is processed by a map task.

2. **Map Task**: Each map task takes a split as input and processes the data to generate key-value pairs. The map function is applied to each record in the input split. The output of the map task is a set of intermediate key-value pairs.

3. **Shuffle and Sort**: The intermediate key-value pairs produced by the map tasks are partitioned, sorted, and shuffled. Each reducer gets all the values associated with a particular key. This step ensures that all values for a given key are grouped together.

4. **Reduce Task**: Each reduce task takes the sorted key-value pairs as input and merges those values to generate the final output. The reduce function is applied to each group of values associated with the same key.

5. **Output Data**: The output of the reduce tasks is written back to HDFS. This output can then be used for further processing or analysis.

### Components of MapReduce in Hadoop

1. **JobTracker**: The JobTracker is a master node that manages the execution of MapReduce jobs. It schedules the jobs, monitors them, and re-executes the failed tasks. The JobTracker is responsible for resource management and job scheduling.

2. **TaskTracker**: The TaskTrackers are worker nodes that run the map and reduce tasks as directed by the JobTracker. Each TaskTracker manages a pool of worker threads to execute the tasks. It sends heartbeats to the JobTracker to provide updates on the status of the tasks.

3. **HDFS**: The Hadoop Distributed File System is used for storing input and output data. It is a distributed, scalable, and portable file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.

4. **JobClient**: The JobClient is a client-side component that submits the MapReduce jobs to the JobTracker. It also provides information about the job's status and statistics.

### Running a Job in Hadoop

1. **Write the MapReduce Program**: Write a MapReduce program that includes the map and reduce functions. The program should specify the input and output data formats and paths.

2. **Compile and Package**: Compile the MapReduce program and package it into a JAR file. This JAR file will be submitted to the Hadoop cluster for execution.

3. **Submit the Job**: Use the Hadoop command line interface or an API to submit the JAR file to the Hadoop cluster. The JobClient sends the job configuration and data to the JobTracker.

4. **Job Initialization**: The JobTracker initializes the job and divides it into multiple map and reduce tasks. It then assigns these tasks to TaskTrackers in the cluster.

5. **Map Phase**: TaskTrackers execute the map tasks on the input data splits. The map function processes each record and produces intermediate key-value pairs.

6. **Shuffle and Sort Phase**: The intermediate data from the map tasks is shuffled and sorted. The data is partitioned based on the keys and prepared for the reduce phase.

7. **Reduce Phase**: TaskTrackers execute the reduce tasks on the sorted key-value pairs. The reduce function processes each key and its associated values to produce the final output.

8. **Output**: The output of the reduce tasks is written to HDFS. The JobTracker updates the job status and notifies the JobClient of the completion of the job.

9. **Monitoring and Debugging**: Throughout the job execution, the JobTracker and TaskTrackers provide status updates and logs. These logs can be used for monitoring the job's progress and debugging any issues.

By following these steps, you can run a MapReduce job in Hadoop and process large-scale data in a distributed and efficient manner.
