1. Draw and explain the block diagram of an Actuator system.

An actuator system comprises of several subsystems, 
(i) a power supply
(ii) a power amplifier
(iii) a servomotor
(iv) a transmission system.

2. What are electric actuators. Mention its advantages and disadvantages

Electric actuators are generally those where an electric motor drives robot links through some mechanical transmission, e.g., gears, etc.

* Advantages: 
    * Widespread availability of power supply.
    * Basic drive element electric motor is usually lighter than pressurized fluid or compressed air.
    * High power-conversion efficiency.
    * No pollution of working environment.
    * Accuracy and repeatability of electric drive robots are normally better than fluid power 
    * Being relatively quiet and clean, they are very acceptable environmentally.
    * They are easily maintained and repaired.
    * Structural components can be lightweight.
    * The drive system is well suited to electronic control.
